                            <p>
                                You’ve definitely met this lounge chair before. Its most classic form has two parts: a slightly reclined chair and a matching ottoman, both upholstered in leather and encased in a molded plywood shell. To look at this chair is to imagine yourself sinking into its plush, leathery surface. However you choose to sit—curled or splayed—this chair invites, even encourages, you to feel at ease.

                            <p>
                                “Let’s face the considerable evidence that all sitting is harmful,” writes Galen Cranz, a design historian whose book The Chair traces this object’s long history. Not all sitting, of course. For people who use wheelchairs, they’re an elegant and crucial technology.
