                <h3>Barcelona Chair</h3>
                <h4>Designer: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich</h4>
                <figure class = "chairs">
                    <img src="g01-barcelona.jpg" alt="colorful collection of chairs in different shades and styles.">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    One of the most frequently used chairs in interior design, the Barcelona Chair resulted from a collaboration between the famous Bauhaus architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and his longtime partner-companion, architect, and designer Lilly Reich.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is one of the most recognized objects of the last century and an icon of the modern movement. The Barcelona Chair displays a simple elegance that exemplifies Mies’ famous maxim – “less is more.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chair is supported on each side by two chrome-plated flat steel bars. Seen from the side, a single curve of the bar forming the chair’s back and front legs crosses the S-curve of the bar forming the seat and back legs, making an intersection of the two. The cantilevered seat and the back of the original chairs were upholstered in white kid leather with welt and button details.
                </p>

                <h3>Eames Lounge Chair</h3>
                <h4>Designer: Charles and Ray Eames</h4>
                <figure class = "chairs">
                    <img src="g02-lounge-chair.jpg" alt="colorful collection of chairs in different shades and styles.">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Ray and Charles Eames were among the most influential furniture designers of their time. In 1956, they designed a Lounge Chair + Ottoman, which was way ahead of its time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The furniture combo was made of black leather and laminate plywood. This unique chair incorporates a two-directional design and is composed of three curved plywood shells draped in leather cushioning. All parts of the chair – headrest, backrest, and seat are identical in proportion and so is the ottoman. This was a pioneering design and the chair is popular to this day.
                </p>

                <h3>Egg Chair</h3>
                <h4>Designer: Arne Jacobsen</h4>
                <figure class = "chairs">
                    <img src="g03-egg-chair.jpg" alt="Brown leather curved chair with footrest.">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The Jacobsen’s Egg Chair first appeared in the reception areas of the Royal Hotel in Copenhagen. This chair was a culmination of a new technique that Jacobsen established with the Egg. Like a sculptor, Jacobsen first sculpted the Egg out of clay in his garage so he could perfect the shape. Then, he molded the Egg Chair out of a strong foam inner shell under the upholstery. It also includes a footrest to complement the sculptural armchair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result is an exclusively unique shape, through which the Egg Chair affords privacy in otherwise public spaces. A testament to the originality and timeless design. The first 50 editions of Egg Chair were made with a variety of colorful fabrics and different leather. It’s the fabric and leather finish coupled with sculptural curves that provide the Egg Chair with a classic appeal.
                </p>

                <h3>Louis Ghost Chair</h3>
                <h4>Designer: Philippe Starck</h4>
                <figure class = "chairs">
                    <img src="g04-louis-ghost-chair.jpg" alt="Plastic, clear chair with oval backrest.">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Named so aptly, Louis Ghost Chair is the essence of baroque revisited to dazzle, excite, and fascinate. It is a comfortable armchair in transparent and colored polycarbonate in the Louis XV style. This unique chair has great charm and considerable visual appeal and brings a touch of elegance and irony to any style of home or public area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the most daring example in the world of injected polycarbonate in a single mold. Despite its fleeting and crystal-clear appearance, Louis Ghost is stable and durable, shock and weather-resistant, and can also be stacked six chairs high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This elegant chair was at the height of European sophistication in the early 18th century, by the turn of the 21st century, this easily reproduced rococo item is nothing short of chintzy.
                </p>

                <h3>Womb Chair</h3>
                <h4>Designer: Eero Saarinen</h4>
                <figure class = "chairs">
                    <img src="g05-womb-chair.jpg" alt="Gray nylon chair within a chair with a matching footrest.">
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Regarded as one of the icons of post-war American modernism, the Womb Chair was designed in 1946 and has been manufactured by Knoll since 1948. This armchair is the first piece of mass-produced furniture in the history of design with an integrated seat shell made of fiber-reinforced plastic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The expansive foam upholstered shell, which has two inset cushions for added comfort, is supported by a bent tubular steel frame. Saarinen developed the Womb Chair in close collaboration with a boat builder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His motive was to design a chair that would allow a variety of sitting positions and create a special feeling of relaxation and coziness. The central design concept finds vivid expression in its name.
                </p>
